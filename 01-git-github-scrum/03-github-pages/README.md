# Deploying to github pages

**1. Create a new repository, clone it, add an index.html, add something to the body of the HTML (could be `<h1>Your Name</h1>`, could be an `<img>` of something. You might have to google or use other README's if your unsure.), push your changes to github.**

**2. In your repository on github, go to the "Settings" tab, then click the "Pages" tab on the left.**

**3. Under Source, click where it says "none" and select "main", then click save.**

**4. This will produce a URL to a live page just above the dropdown menu you clicked on. It may not show up for a minute or two, so try to refresh the page.**

**6. Add the live URL to your README.md, push those changes to github. You should now see the live link on your repository home page on github.**
