# NPM Colors

* There are tons of packages available to use on NPM and plenty of articles discussing some of the best packages currently for developers: https://colorlib.com/wp/npm-packages-node-js/ , https://qualifiedgeek.com/best-npm-packages/ , https://leanylabs.com/blog/npm-packages-for-nodejs/ . To give us a little bit of practice and an intro into using a package from npm we are going to use two that are a little easier to understand and see a visual outcome from. It will still require us to read the documentation, install the packages, and try to put the packages to use. 

* The npm packages that we are going to use are "colors" and "inquirer". "colors" allows us to spice up the information we print to the console by being able to change the text color and background color of what is displayed. Check out the documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors). The other package "inquirer" allows us to ask the user information in the command line and then do something with their response. Check out the documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

* You will need to run `npm install colors inquirer` in order for the packages to work.

* For this activity you are going to have 60 minutes to create a command line application that asks the user questions and does something with their answers. The information displayed to the page should also be colored using the "colors" package.

* Check out example.js to give an idea of some types of questions you can ask and how to handle the users response.
