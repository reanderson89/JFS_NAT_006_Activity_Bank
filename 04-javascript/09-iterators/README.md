# Create a branch for this folder of activities: (It is always recommended to create a branch for each activity that we do, this way you can keep your main branch clean)
- Create a new branch for this activity:
    - git checkout -b 09-iterators 
- When you finish the activity make sure to "add" your changes and "commit" them:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "finished activity"
- Then return to the main branch:
    - git checkout main

## You can use this branch for all of the activities in this folder

The instructions for each activity are given as comments in the separate script.js files
