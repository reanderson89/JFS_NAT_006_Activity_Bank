# Getting Started

* Please follow the first five steps in the documentation found [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

* When you install the jest package, install it in the 15-jest folder, this way you can use it for all of your folders inside of the 15-jest folder. To install into the 15-jest folder, make sure you are currently in the 15-jest folder when you run the `npm i --save-dev jest` command

* In order to run a specific test file you will need to use the command `npm test testName.test.js`

* You can also run all of the tests in the entire folder by just doing `npm test`. This will only work if you followed the documentation instructions and added the "scripts" part in the package.json file.
