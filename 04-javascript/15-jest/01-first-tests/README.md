# First Test

* In order to run a specific test file you will need to use the command `npm test testName.test.js`

* For this activity your goal is to create 2 tests. 
    - One test that should check that the sum function is working properly. This is the same test from the 00-getting-started activity
    - The other should test if the difference function is working properly.
