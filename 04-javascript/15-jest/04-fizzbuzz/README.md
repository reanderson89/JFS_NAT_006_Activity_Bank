# fizzbuzz

* For this activity you are tasked to create the tests for the fizzbuzz coding challenge and then writing the code to solve the fizzbuzz challenge.

## What is fizzbuzz?

* The Fizz Buzz challenge is a programming exercise that involves creating a function that returns a specific output based on a given input. Here are the requirements for the Fizz Buzz challenge:

* Your program or function should take a number as an input.
    - If the number is divisible by 3, the program should return "Fizz".
    - If the number is divisible by 5, the program should return "Buzz".
    - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program should return "FizzBuzz".
    - If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the program should return the number itself.

* Example Outputs:
    - If the input number is 3, 6, or 9..., the output should be "Fizz".
    - If the input number is 5, 10, 20...,  the output should be "Buzz".
    - If the input number is 15, 30, or 45..., the output should be "FizzBuzz".
    - If the input number is 7, the output should be 7. (essentially if it is NOT DIVISIBLE by 3 or 5, it should just return the number itself)

## The process
* For this activity you will create 4 tests, one for each bit of logic given above.

* Open the fizzBuzz.test.js and write a test, then open the fizzBuzz.js file and write the logic for the activity. Run the test and make sure that your logic works. Then move onto the next test.
