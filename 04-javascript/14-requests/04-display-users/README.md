# Display Users

* For this activity you are tasked to dynamically create bootstrap cards and display them on the browser. Each user will get their own card. The card should have the following information:
    - It should display the users first and last name
    - It should show a picture of the user
    - it should display their email address
    - You should also store the users "id" as a `data-` attribute on the card so that you can refer to the user later on when making requests. Info about `data-` can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_data-.asp)
