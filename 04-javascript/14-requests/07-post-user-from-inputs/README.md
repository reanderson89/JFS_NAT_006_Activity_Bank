# Post User

* For this activity you are tasked to post a User to the [reqres](https://reqres.in/) API. Make sure to use the documentation from their webpage to help with setting up your users information. Also check out this video from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0) about posting with fetch().

* You should be able to enter the users information into the input fields. When they are submitted display a message to the screen, letting the user know the employee was either submitted successfully or not.

* Start by hard coding a POST request, and then once you get that working, make the request based off of user input.
