# Build a Weather App

For this activity you will be using a weather API from: https://www.weatherapi.com/  - (I believe this one is easier to use) or you could use this one https://openweathermap.org/api

You will need to create a free account in order to get your own api-key. You can find the documentation on their website on how to write your url to get the information you need: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/


I used the https://openweathermap.org/api to complete the project:

- Here is a weather app that I built using this weather API: https://reanderson89.github.io/weather-dashboard/

- Here is the github repo for the project: https://github.com/reanderson89/weather-dashboard

# We are not worried about how this application looks, just how it functions. 
    - The basic html has been created for you, please feel free to make it look better once you have full functionality.
    - You will need to display the "conditions".
    - Also display the image associated with the conditions.
    - The current temperature in fahrenheit should be shown.
    - Make sure to also display the name of the city that was searched.

## skills you will have to use
    - DOM manipulation
    - API calls
    - Reading documentation and looking up what you don't know
    - object and array notation
    - functions
    - built in methods of javascript objects


### Bonus

* Use local storage to save all of the cities searched for and be able to add a clickable button for each city that will show the current weather when clicked. The page should also show the last city searched for when refreshed. When you store things in local storage they will be stored as strings. Use the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() as needed to store and retrieve information in the correct format that you need.

* Here are a list of resources to help you work with localStorage:
