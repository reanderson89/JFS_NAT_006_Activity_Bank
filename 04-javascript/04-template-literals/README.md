# Start by: (It is always recommended to create a branch for each activity that we do, this way you can keep your main branch clean)
- Create a new branch for this activity:
    - git checkout -b 04-template-literals 
- When you finish the activity make sure to "add" your changes and "commit" them:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "finished activity"
- Then return to the main branch:
    - git checkout main

Make sure that you connected the script.js to the html file

For this activity you will use template literals (a way to insert variables into strings) to create the following sentence:

"The fox jumped over the fence."
