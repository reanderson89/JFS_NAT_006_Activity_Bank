# Interactive RPS

* For this activity you are tasked to turn the rock, paper, scissors game into an interactive game on the browser. You should no longer use the `alert()`, `prompt()`, or `confirm()` to display information or get information from the user. The user should be able to select their answer from the buttons given, and play against the computer.

* It is up to you to decide the flow of your program. You will need to accept user input to get their choice from the button used.

* When a user makes their choice it should be displayed on the screen, and they should also see the computers choice displayed as well.

* Their should be a place that shows the users choice vs. the computers choice and also verifies who won.

* The current standings of the games should be updated as the games are played.

* The game should be re-playable, without having to refresh the page.

* All of the HTML elements you will need already exist. Feel free to add more or change ones that are already there. You can add, edit, or remove whatever elements and/or attributes you deem necessary to complete the activity.
