// Using these two given variables, perform the math that is asked in the comments below. Use the "THIS SHOULD ADD" comment as an example to get started.
let num1 = 3;
let num2 = 9;

// THIS SHOULD ADD
 let add = num1 + num2;
 
 console.log(add);

// THIS SHOULD SUBTRACT NUM1 FROM NUM2 


// THIS SHOULD MULTIPLY NUM1 & NUM2 


// THIS SHOULD DIVIDE NUM1 FROM NUM2 


// THIS SHOULD FIND THE MODULUS OF NUM1 FROM NUM2 

// print your answers in the console
