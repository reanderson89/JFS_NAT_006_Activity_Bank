## Find the Largest Number in an Array
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array. You should use a loop to iterate through the array elements and a conditional statement to compare each number to the current largest value.

Example input: [12, 45, 67, 34, 29, 89, 38]
Example output: 89
