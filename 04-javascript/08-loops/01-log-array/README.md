# Create a branch for this activity: (It is always recommended to create a branch for each activity that we do, this way you can keep your main branch clean)
- Create a new branch for this activity:
    - git checkout -b 08-loops 
- When you finish the activity make sure to "add" your changes and "commit" them:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "finished activity"
- Then return to the main branch:
    - git checkout main

## Feel free to use the 08-loops branch for each activity in the 08-loops folder

- For this activity you need to write a "for" loop that will log each string from the given array to the console.

- Make sure that you are only logging one item in the array each time the loop runs, and not the entire array.
