# let-const

# Start by: (It is always recommended to create a branch for each activity that we do, this way you can keep your main branch clean)
- Create a new branch for this activity:
    - git checkout -b 02-variables 
- When you finish the activity make sure to "add" your changes and "commit" them:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "finished activity"
- Then return to the main branch:
    - git checkout main

Make sure that you have connected your script.js to your index.html

In your script.js file, create 3 different variables using "let" and "const". Try out different data types. Numbers, booleans, strings, etc...

Try re-assigning a "let" variable and a "const" variable.

Then, print those variables to the console using console.log()
