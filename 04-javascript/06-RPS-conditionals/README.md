# RPS-Conditionals

# Create a branch for this activity: (It is always recommended to create a branch for each activity that we do, this way you can keep your main branch clean)
- Create a new branch for this activity:
    - git checkout -b 06-RPS-conditionals 
- When you finish the activity make sure to "add" your changes and "commit" them:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "finished activity"
- Then return to the main branch:
    - git checkout main


- In this activity you are tasked to create the logic behind a game of rock paper scissors.
- You will need variables and conditionals to get it working. If you do the bonus after, you will need to look up Math.random() and prompt() and alert()

## Rules for rock-paper-scissors

* Rock: beats scissors, loses to paper, and ties against itself.
* Paper: beats rock, loses to scissors, and ties against itself.
* Scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, and ties against itself.

## Start with:

- Creating variables for the two players and hard-code either "rock", "paper", or "scissors" on them.
- Create the conditions to check the variables against each other to see who the winner will be. Use the above "Rules" to help you build the logic.
- However the game ends, there should be a result printed to the console.

## Bonus
- Change one of the players to a randomly generated value instead of a hard-coded value. (Hint: Google and Math.random() will be your friend)
- Use a prompt() to get the users input 
- Use an alert() to show the matchup of the users input and display who won
